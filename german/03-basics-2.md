## German plurals—the nominative Case
In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as
straightforward as adding an "s" or an "es" at the end of the word. In
German, the transformation is more complex, and also the articles for
each gender change. The following five suggestions can help:

-e ending: most German one-syllable nouns will need -e in their plural
form. For example, in the nominative case, "das Brot" (the bread)
becomes "die Brote," and "das Spiel" (the game) becomes "die Spiele."

-er ending: most masculine or neuter nouns will need the -er ending,
and there may be umlaut changes. For example, in the nominative case
"das Kind" (the child) becomes "die Kinder," and "der Mann" (the man)
becomes "die Männer."

-n/-en ending: most feminine nouns will take either -n or -en in all
four grammatical cases, with no umlaut changes. For example, "die
Frau" (the woman) becomes "die Frauen" and "die Kartoffel" becomes
"die Kartoffeln."

-s ending: most foreign-origin nouns will take the -s ending for the
plural, usually with no umlaut changes. For example: "der Chef" (the
boss) becomes "die Chefs."

There is no change for most neuter or masculine nouns that contain any
of these in the singular: -chen, -lein, -el, or -er. There may be
umlaut changes. For example: "das Mädchen" (the girl) becomes "die
Mädchen," and "die Mutter" (the mother) becomes "die Mütter."

**Regardless of grammatical gender, all plural nouns take the definite
article "die" (in the nominative case).** This does not make them
feminine. The grammatical gender of a word never changes. Like many
other words, "die" is simply used for multiple purposes.

Just like in English, there's no plural indefinite article.

ein Mann = a man

Männer = men

## German feminine plurals—nouns ending in -in
Feminine nouns that end in "-in" will need "-nen" in the plural. For
example, "die Köchin" (the female cook) becomes "die Köchinnen" in its
plural form.

## *ihr* vs *er*
If you're new to German, *ihr* and *er* may sound exactly the same,
but there is actually a difference. ihr sounds similar to the English
word ear, and er sounds similar to the English word air (imagine a
British/RP accent).

Don't worry if you can't pick up on the difference at first. You may
need some more listening practice before you can tell them
apart. Also, try using headphones instead of speakers.

Even if this doesn't seem to help, knowing your conjugation tables
will greatly reduce the amount of ambiguity.

German | English
--- | ---
ich bin | I am
du bist | you (singular informal) are
er/sie/es ist | he/she/it is
wir sind | we are
ihr seid | you (plural informal) are
sie sind | they are
Sie sind | you (formal) are

## You are can refer to one or more people
In your own dialect, you might prefer to use something like *y'all* or
*you guys* when addressing more than one person, but remember that, in
Standard English, *you are* can refer to one person or multiple
people. When translating *you are* into German, you need to decide
whether to use *du bist* (informal, addressing one person) or *ihr
seid* (informal, addressing more than one person).

(There's also the formal you (Sie sind), which will be introduced
later in the course.)
